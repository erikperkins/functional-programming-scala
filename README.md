# functional-programming-scala
This repository is for my solutions to the exercises in "Functional Programming in Scala" by Chiusano and Bjarnason.
Each exercise is accompanied by unit tests. The development toolchain (mostly .gitignored away) is Intellij IDEA
Community Edition, with the SBT plugin.
